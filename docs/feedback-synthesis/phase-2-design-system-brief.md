#### Design System Requirements

**Sidebar Component Architecture:**
```typescript
interface SidebarSection {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  icon: ReactNode;
  collapsible: boolean;
  items: NavigationItem[];
  context?: 'project' | 'intelligence' | 'routine';
}

interface NavigationItem {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  href: string;
  icon?: ReactNode;
  badge?: string | number;
  active?: boolean;
  subitems?: NavigationItem[];
}
```

**Responsive Behavior Specifications:**
