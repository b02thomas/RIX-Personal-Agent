# RIX Complete Validation & Local Deployment

## Mission: Validate Phase 1-6 Features AND Get System Running Locally

You are a **Deployment & Validation Specialist** for the RIX Personal AI Second Brain system. Your job is to:
1. **Validate all Phase 1-6 implementations** are complete and working
2. **Set up and deploy the system locally** so it runs on localhost
3. **Create a working demo** that shows all implemented features

## Repository Information
- **Repository**: https://github.com/b02thomas/RIX-Personal-Agent
- **Structure**: `/RIX/` (Frontend) + `/main-agent/` (Backend)
- **Goal**: Working system on localhost with all Phase 1-6 features visible

## Target Result: Working Local System
After completion, the user should be able to:
- ✅ Visit `http://localhost:3000` and see RIX frontend
- ✅ Login and explore all implemented features
- ✅ See working navigation (sidebar, mobile responsive)
- ✅ Use Projects, Routines, Calendar, Intelligence features
- ✅ Chat interface responding (mock mode)
- ✅ Main Agent API accessible at `http://localhost:8001`

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### **Step 1: Repository Setup & Analysis**
1. **Clone and analyze the repository:**
   - Clone from GitHub if not already done
   - Analyze project structure and verify all directories exist
   - Check if all expected files from Phase 1-6 are present

2. **Validate Phase 1-6 Implementation:**
   - **Navigation System**: Enhanced sidebar, mobile navigation, responsive design
   - **Core Features**: Projects (health scoring), Routines (habit tracking), Calendar (time-blocking)
   - **Intelligence Features**: Knowledge management, Goal tracking, Analytics
   - **N8N Integration**: Workflow management UI, settings interface
   - **Database Schema**: All tables, pgvector setup, proper relationships

### **Step 2: Environment & Dependencies Setup**
1. **System Requirements Check:**
   - Verify Node.js 18+ is available
   - Verify Python 3.9+ is available
   - Check if PostgreSQL or Docker is available for database

2. **Database Setup (Choose best option):**
   ```bash
   # Option A: Docker (Recommended)
   # Create docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL + pgvector
   
   # Option B: Local PostgreSQL
   # Set up PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
   ```

3. **Frontend Environment:**
   ```env
   # Create .env.local
   NODE_ENV=development
   AUTH_MODE=mock
   N8N_MODE=mock
   JWT_SECRET=development-secret-key
   DB_REQUIRED=false
   MOCK_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@rix.com
   MOCK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
   ```

4. **Main Agent Environment:**
   ```env
   # Create .env
   DEBUG=true
   HOST=0.0.0.0
   PORT=8001
   JWT_SECRET=development-secret-key
   
   # Database configuration
   DB_USER=rix_user
   DB_PASSWORD=development_password
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=rix_personal_agent
   
   # MCP Endpoints (mock mode)
   MCP_TASK_ENDPOINT=/mcp/task-management
   MCP_CALENDAR_ENDPOINT=/mcp/calendar-intelligence
   # ... all other MCP endpoints
   ```

### **Step 3: Installation & Build Process**
1. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd RIX/
   npm install
   npm run type-check  # Must pass
   npm run lint        # Must pass
   npm run build       # Must succeed
   ```

2. **Main Agent Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd main-agent/
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 -c "from app.main import app; print('✅ Main Agent imports successful')"
   ```

3. **Database Initialization:**
   - Start PostgreSQL (Docker or local)
   - Create database and user
   - Initialize all Phase 1-6 tables
   - Set up pgvector extension

### **Step 4: System Startup & Validation**
1. **Start All Services:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Database
   docker-compose up -d postgres  # or start local PostgreSQL
   
   # Terminal 2: Main Agent
   cd main-agent/
   source venv/bin/activate
   python3 main.py
   
   # Terminal 3: Frontend
   cd RIX/
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Health Checks:**
   - ✅ Frontend: `http://localhost:3000` shows login page
   - ✅ Main Agent: `http://localhost:8001/health` returns healthy status
   - ✅ API Docs: `http://localhost:8001/docs` shows all endpoints
   - ✅ Database: Connection successful, all tables created

### **Step 5: Feature Validation & Demo**
1. **Authentication Test:**
   - Login at `http://localhost:3000` with mock credentials
   - Verify JWT authentication flow works
   - Confirm redirect to dashboard

2. **Navigation System Test:**
   - ✅ Enhanced sidebar with project hierarchy
   - ✅ Collapsible sidebar (280px ↔ 64px)
   - ✅ Mobile responsive (resize browser to test)
   - ✅ Bottom navigation on mobile
   - ✅ Theme toggle (Dark/Light/System)

3. **Core Features Test:**
   ```
   Projects Page:
   - ✅ Project cards with health scores (0-100)
   - ✅ Add/Edit/Delete projects
   - ✅ Status tracking (Planning/Active/Completed)
   - ✅ Priority levels and tag management
   
   Routines Page:
   - ✅ Habit tracking interface
   - ✅ Daily completion checkboxes
   - ✅ Progress visualization and streaks
   - ✅ Add/Edit routines

   - ✅ Knowledge management
   ```

4. **Chat Interface Test:**
   - Send messages in chat interface
   - Verify mock responses from Main Agent
   - Test different message types

5. **API Integration Test:**
   - Test Frontend ↔ Main Agent communication
   - Verify all API routes respond correctly
   - Check database operations work

### **Step 6: Create Startup Scripts**
Create easy-to-use startup scripts:

1. **Complete Setup Script (`setup-rix.sh`):**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Complete RIX setup script
   # - Installs dependencies
   # - Sets up database
   # - Creates environment files
   # - Validates installation
   ```

2. **Quick Start Script (`start-rix.sh`):**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Quick start script
   # - Starts database
   # - Starts Main Agent in background
   # - Starts Frontend
   # - Shows access URLs
   ```

3. **Health Check Script (`check-rix.sh`):**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Health check script
   # - Tests all endpoints
   # - Validates database connection
   # - Confirms all services running
   ```

## Expected Deliverables

### **1. Validation Report:**
```

- ✅ Complete user journey from login to feature exploration

### **3. Deployment Package:**
- Complete setup scripts for easy installation
- Environment configuration files
- Database setup and initialization
- Startup and health check scripts
- Troubleshooting guide

### **4. Feature Demonstration Guide:**
Step-by-step guide showing:
- How to access each implemented feature
- What functionality is available
- How to test different components
- Screenshots/descriptions of what should be visible

## Success Criteria
After completion:
- ✅ User can run single command to start complete system
- ✅ All Phase 1-6 features are visible and functional
- ✅ Navigation system works perfectly (desktop + mobile)
- ✅ All core features (Projects, Routines, Calendar) are usable
- ✅ Intelligence features show proper interfaces
- ✅ Chat interface responds with mock data
- ✅ System is ready for N8N MCP integration later
- ✅ Complete documentation for using the system

## Important Notes
- **Use mock mode** for all AI/LLM functionality (N8N_MODE=mock)
- **Maintain RIX PRD compliance** (Main Agent as router only)
- **Focus on user experience** - make sure everything looks and works great
- **Document everything** - create guides for using each feature
- **Test thoroughly** - ensure all functionality works as expected

Begin with repository analysis and setup, then proceed through each step systematically to deliver a fully working local RIX system.
