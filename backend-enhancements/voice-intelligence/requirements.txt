# Requirements for RIX Voice Intelligence Phase 1
# Enhanced Voice Processor Foundation with German Intelligence

# Core dependencies
openai>=1.0.0                    # OpenAI Whisper API integration
fastapi>=0.104.1                 # API framework (should match main agent)
pydantic>=2.0.0                  # Data validation and settings
python-multipart>=0.0.6         # File upload support for FastAPI

# Audio processing (optional for enhanced features)
numpy>=1.24.0                    # Numerical computing for audio analysis
librosa>=0.10.0                  # Advanced audio processing (optional)

# Database integration (for future phases)
asyncpg>=0.29.0                  # PostgreSQL async driver

# Logging and monitoring
structlog>=23.0.0                # Structured logging

# Development and testing
pytest>=7.4.0                    # Testing framework
pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0          # Async testing support
pytest-mock>=3.11.0             # Mocking for tests

# Performance monitoring
psutil>=5.9.0                    # System performance monitoring

# Notes:
# - numpy and librosa are optional dependencies for enhanced audio processing
# - If not available, the system falls back to basic audio processing
# - All dependencies should be compatible with main-agent requirements
# - OpenAI API key required for Whisper transcription functionality
