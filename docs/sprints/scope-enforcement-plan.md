# This document provides actionable protocols for preventing scope creep throughout development
# RELEVANT FILES: docs/sprints/locked-scope.md, docs/sprints/change-control-process.md, docs/sprints/phase-priorities.md

## Enforcement Overview

This document establishes **MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOLS** for maintaining the locked scope defined in `/docs/sprints/locked-scope.md`. Every team member, stakeholder, and external contributor must follow these protocols to ensure project success within the defined timeline.

### Enforcement Authority Hierarchy
1. **Sprint Prioritizer** (Product Manager): Final scope authority, change approval only
2. **Lead Developer**: Technical enforcement, scope compliance validation
3. **Development Team**: Day-to-day scope rejection, protocol implementation
4. **Scrum Master**: Process enforcement, meeting facilitation
5. **Stakeholders**: Scope respect, formal change requests only

## Daily Scope Protection Protocols

### Development Team Daily Practices

#### Morning Stand-up Scope Check
**MANDATORY**: Every daily stand-up must include scope validation:

```
Stand-up Agenda (5 minutes):
1. Yesterday's work (2 min)
2. Today's planned work (2 min)
3. Scope compliance check (1 min)
   - "Is today's work within locked scope?"
   - "Any scope expansion requests received?"
   - "Any blockers requiring scope clarification?"
```

#### Code Review Scope Gates
**MANDATORY**: All code reviews must include scope compliance check:

```
Scope Compliance Checklist for Pull Requests:
☐ Feature implemented is in locked scope document
☐ No additional features or enhancements added
☐ Implementation follows exact specifications
☐ No "nice-to-have" improvements included
☐ Performance requirements maintained
☐ Mobile experience preserved
```

#### Task Creation Scope Validation
**MANDATORY**: Before creating any development task:

```
Task Scope Validation Process:
1. Reference locked scope document section
2. Confirm task is explicitly listed in deliverables
3. Verify task aligns with phase objectives
4. Check task doesn't exceed specification boundaries
5. Document scope reference in task description
```

### Stakeholder Communication Protocols

#### Scope Expansion Request Response (IMMEDIATE)
When receiving scope expansion requests, team members must respond within 2 hours:

**Template Response for Feature Requests**:
```
Thank you for your suggestion regarding [FEATURE/ENHANCEMENT]. 

Our project scope is currently locked based on comprehensive Phase 1 UX research to ensure successful delivery within our 10-week timeline. This suggestion falls outside our locked scope for the current project.

I'm documenting your request for consideration in our post-project roadmap planning. If you believe this is a critical change requiring immediate evaluation, please submit a formal change request to our Sprint Prioritizer using the change control process.

Current locked scope: Projects with AI, Smart Calendar, Routines with Coaching, Intelligence Overview only.

Best regards,
[NAME]
```

#### Weekly Stakeholder Scope Communication
**MANDATORY**: Every Friday, send scope status to all stakeholders:

**Template Weekly Scope Status**:
```
Subject: RIX Development - Weekly Scope Status

Week [X] Scope Status:
✅ Scope Adherence: [%] compliance with locked deliverables
📋 Feature Progress: [Summary of progress on 4 core features]
🚫 Rejected Requests: [Number] scope expansion requests properly rejected
⚠️  At-Risk Items: [Any items requiring attention]
📅 Next Week Focus: [Planned work within locked scope]

Scope Protection Working: Zero unauthorized features added.
Timeline on Track: [Phase X] deliverables progressing as planned.

Questions? Contact Sprint Prioritizer for scope clarifications.
```

## Meeting Scope Enforcement

### Sprint Planning Scope Control
**MANDATORY**: All sprint planning meetings must enforce scope:

#### Sprint Planning Agenda (2 hours maximum)
```
Hour 1: Scope Review & Validation
├── 15 min: Review locked scope for current phase
├── 15 min: Validate all planned work against scope
├── 15 min: Reject any out-of-scope items
└── 15 min: Confirm sprint goal aligns with locked deliverables

Hour 2: Task Planning Within Scope
├── 30 min: Break down locked deliverables into tasks
├── 15 min: Estimate effort for approved tasks only
├── 10 min: Identify dependencies within locked scope
└── 5 min: Confirm sprint commitment matches locked scope
```

#### Sprint Planning Scope Validation Checklist
```
Before Sprint Commitment:
☐ All planned work explicitly listed in locked scope
☐ Sprint goal matches phase objective exactly
☐ No "improvement" or "enhancement" tasks added
☐ Performance and quality requirements maintained
☐ No experimental or research tasks included
☐ All team members confirm scope understanding
```

### Daily Stand-up Scope Enforcement
**MANDATORY**: Every stand-up includes scope check:

```
Stand-up Scope Protocol:
1. If team member mentions work not in locked scope:
   → IMMEDIATE STOP
   → Reference locked scope document
   → Redirect to approved work only

2. If team member requests scope clarification:
   → Note for Sprint Prioritizer follow-up
   → Continue with approved work until clarified

3. If team member identifies scope creep:
   → Document immediately
   → Assess impact on timeline
   → Escalate to Sprint Prioritizer if needed
```

### Sprint Review Scope Validation
**MANDATORY**: Every sprint review must validate scope compliance:

```
Sprint Review Scope Assessment:
☐ All delivered features were in locked scope
☐ No unauthorized features or enhancements added
☐ Quality gates met for delivered scope
☐ Performance requirements maintained
☐ Next sprint planning prepared within locked scope
```

## Change Control Enforcement

### Change Request Processing (FORMAL ONLY)

#### Change Request Intake Process
**WHO CAN SUBMIT**: Any stakeholder (but processed formally only)
**PROCESSING TIME**: 5-7 business days for major changes, 24-48 hours for minor
**APPROVAL AUTHORITY**: Sprint Prioritizer ONLY

#### Change Request Validation Steps
```
Step 1: Initial Assessment (Lead Developer - 24 hours)
├── Is this a bug fix? → Auto-approve, no process needed
├── Is this a clarification? → Expedited process (48 hours)
├── Is this scope expansion? → Full formal process (5-7 days)
└── Is this scope modification? → Full formal process (5-7 days)

Step 2: Impact Analysis (Lead Developer + Sprint Prioritizer - 48 hours)
├── Timeline impact assessment
├── Resource requirement analysis  
├── Quality impact evaluation
├── Risk assessment for project success
└── Alternative solution exploration

Step 3: Business Justification Review (Sprint Prioritizer - 24 hours)
├── Critical business need validation
├── Cost-benefit analysis
├── Stakeholder alignment verification
├── User value assessment
└── Strategic importance evaluation
```

#### Change Request Decision Matrix
```
APPROVE if:
✅ Critical business need (user/legal/security)
✅ No timeline impact OR acceptable delay
✅ Resources available without compromising quality
✅ Aligns with project strategic objectives
✅ Risk is manageable and mitigatable

REJECT if:
❌ "Nice to have" or convenience feature
❌ Timeline impact unacceptable
❌ Resource requirements exceed capacity
❌ Introduces unacceptable risk
❌ Not aligned with strategic objectives
```

### Emergency Change Protocol

#### Emergency Change Criteria (RESTRICTIVE)
**ONLY these qualify for emergency bypass**:
- Critical security vulnerability (data breach risk)
- Data loss prevention (user data at risk)
- Legal compliance requirement (immediate legal risk)
- System failure causing complete unavailability

#### Emergency Change Process
```
Emergency Authorization:
1. Lead Developer + Sprint Prioritizer can approve immediately
2. Implementation begins while documentation is created
3. Full change control process completed within 48 hours
4. All stakeholders notified within 2 hours
5. Post-implementation review required within 1 week
```
