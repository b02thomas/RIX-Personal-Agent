## Process Overview

This document establishes the formal change control process for the RIX Second Brain development project. The process ensures that scope changes are properly evaluated, approved, and documented while maintaining project timeline and quality commitments.

### Change Control Authority
- **Primary Authority**: Product Manager (final approval/rejection)
- **Technical Assessment**: Lead Developer (impact analysis)
- **Stakeholder Input**: Project sponsors (business justification)
- **Development Team**: Implementation feasibility assessment

## Change Categories

### Category 1: Automatic Approvals (No Process Required)
These changes are pre-approved and can be implemented immediately:

1. **Critical Bug Fixes**
